I dedicated the tribute page to **Michael Jackson** as his music brings a lot of joy in my life. I wanted to portray this joy in the form of a tribute page to him. 

I learnt a lot more about how to use HTML and CSS and how they work together to make a page alive. 

 found this project particulary hard because there were a wide range of different components to incorporate to finish the project. I didn't seem to be able to get a higher score than **9/10** for my tribute page, no matter what changes I had implemented. I _hope_ to learn about where I went wrong during the course and as a result learn from this experience.
